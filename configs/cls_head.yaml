# Data configuration
img_size: 224
total_batch_size: 64  # Smaller batch size for fine-tuning classification head
num_workers: 8

# Training hyperparameters (optimized for classification head fine-tuning)
epochs: 30  # 20-50 epochs typical for fine-tuning with pre-trained backbone
lr: 0.001  # Smaller LR for fine-tuning (vs 0.03 for MoCo pretraining)

# General Guidelines (LR and epochs may vary based on dataset size):
# Small dataset (<1000 images): Freeze backbone ✓
# Medium dataset (1000-10k): Fine-tune with low learning rate
# Large dataset (>10k): Fine-tune with normal learning rate

weight_decay: 0.0001  # Standard L2 regularization
use_amp: true  # Automatic mixed precision for faster training
val_fraction: 0.2  # 20% validation split for better generalization

# Saving & checkpointing
save_every_epochs: 5  # Save checkpoint every 5 epochs
seed: 42
